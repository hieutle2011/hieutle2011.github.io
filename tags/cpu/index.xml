      <description>Last week, my wife came to BKK to see me and we had a wonderful short trip to Koh Lan island just 40 minutes away from Pattaya. It had been almost 2 months since we last met when i was in Vietnam back then, so that we did enjoyed our time together. Moreover, we accompanied 2 great friends in Son and Tik and all four of us took photos, shared stories and laughed so hard in that sea food restaurant while playing Tik-guessing game and drinking beers.</description>
