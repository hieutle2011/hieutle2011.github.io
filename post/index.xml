      <description>Background
The computer&amp;rsquo;s main memory, also called Random Access Memory, or RAM, is an addressable sequence of n-bit registers, each designed to hold an n-bit value. In this project you will gradually build a RAM unit. This involves two main issues: (i) how to use gate logic to store bits persistently, over time, and (ii) how to use gate logic to locate (&amp;ldquo;address&amp;rdquo;) the memory register on which we wish to operate.</description>

      <description>Background
The centerpiece of the computer&amp;rsquo;s architecture is the CPU, or Central Processing Unit, and the centerpiece of the CPU is the ALU, or Arithmetic-Logic Unit. In this project you will gradually build a set of chips, culminating in the construction of the ALU chip of the Hack computer. All the chips built in this project are standard, except for the ALU itself, which differs from one computer architecture to another.</description>

      <description>Background
A typical computer architecture is based on a set of elementary logic gates like And, Or, Mux, etc., as well as their bit-wise versions And16, Or16, Mux16, etc. (assuming a 16-bit machine). This project engages you in the construction of a typical set of basic logic gates. These gates form the elementary building blocks from which more complex chips will be later constructed.
 Here is what i have learnt in this week.</description>

      <description>Well, recently i often work with docker and control config on server, i suffered a lot due to my weakness regards vim usage on linux.
Turn out, these basic things prove significant as you&amp;rsquo;d like to pursue DevOps career.
It would be great to improve on my vim skill by taking note down the essential of this powerful editor. Moreover, there is one tutor right in your Ubuntu terminal.</description>

      <description>There are many types of compress file, with each type we should have different command to interact with it. To find which archive type we are working with, use file command.
$ file a.zip a.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract $ file b.tar b.tar: POSIX tar archive (GNU) $ file c.tar.gz c.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Tue Aug 20 04:33:47 2019, from Unix Here are some most common types i&amp;rsquo;ve been working with recently.</description>
