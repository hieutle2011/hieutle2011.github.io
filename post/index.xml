      <description>Counting is the religion of this generation, its hope and salvation.
&amp;ndash; Gertrude Stein (1874â€“1946)
 1. The Theory Key concepts: Binary numbers, binary addition, the two&amp;rsquo;s complement method, half-adders, full-adders, n-bit adders, counters, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), combinational logic.
After finishing week 1 rather quick, i was eager to start week 2 and looking forward to next type of chips. The theory is presented in such an easy way that i can do arithmetic calculation base 2 and 10, negative numbers right away.</description>

      <description>What i have learnt in this week.
1.Boolean laws Any boolean function can be represented using an expression containing only NAND operations.
Proof:  NOT(x) = (x NAND x)
 (x AND y) = NOT(x NAND y)
  2.Hardware description language  In computer engineering, a hardware description language is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of electronic circuits, and most commonly, digital logic circuits.</description>

      <description>Well, recently i often work with docker and control config on server, i suffered a lot due to my weakness regards vim usage on linux.
Turn out, these basic things prove significant as you&amp;rsquo;d like to pursue DevOps career.
It would be great to improve on my vim skill by taking note down the essential of this powerful editor. Moreover, there is one tutor right in your Ubuntu terminal.</description>

      <description>There are many types of compress file, with each type we should have different command to interact with it. To find which archive type we are working with, use file command.
$ file a.zip a.zip: Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract $ file b.tar b.tar: POSIX tar archive (GNU) $ file c.tar.gz c.tar.gz: gzip compressed data, last modified: Tue Aug 20 04:33:47 2019, from Unix Here are some most common types i&amp;rsquo;ve been working with recently.</description>
